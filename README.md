## About the Video Course
	Java EE 8 High Performance aims how to use Java EE for mission- or performance-critical applications. How to monitor the state and performance metrics of your program in a distributed environment. To make use of concurrency and multiple cores provided by modern processor architectures plus the support offered by Java 8. Common pitfalls and How you can scale your application to meet higher demand by adding cluster and load-balancing techniques. As well as optimization tools and frameworks like the Java Cache standard, Eclipse Collections or Javolution.
The course starts with the basics of Java Concurrency, Java EE Concurrency, followed by Caching solutions and High-Performance frameworks for Java SE and EE. Then, learn Troubleshooting performance problems, Monitoring the JVM stats and wider Performance Monitoring as well as Tools for Stress and Load Testing.
